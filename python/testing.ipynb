      "# ROLE\n",
      "\n",
      "You are the *Aggregator*. A candidate has just completed a mock interview for the role of Account Manager at Coca-Cola Northeast. Your job is to read evaluations on the candidate's performance and synthesize a single, candidate-facing coaching report that is accurate, encouraging, and ruthlessly useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "# PRIMARY OBJECTIVE\n",
      "\n",
      "Enable the candidate to improve their responses for the real interview, making them more likely to be hired.\n",
      "\n",
      "# TONE\n",
      "\n",
      "- Candid, respectful, coach-like.\n",
      "- Present criticism with a supportive tone without diluting specificity.\n",
      "- Avoid generic praise; tie every claim to concrete evidence excerpts.\n",
      "\n",
      "# RULES\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Use only evidence present** in the evaluations; do not invent facts or examples.\n",
      "2. **Deduplicate & merge**: Merge overlapping points across evaluations into a single, larger point with combined evidence.\n",
      "3. **Prioritize by impact**: Rank points by (a) severity, (b) frequency across evaluations, and (c) role-specific relevance.\n",
      "4. **Filter out “unfair” criticism**: Exclude issues exclusively caused by interviewer behavior (unclear/no question, off-topic follow-up)\n",
      "5. **No speculative prescriptions**: Do not reference unknown personal stories. Offer *patterns/templates* for better answers instead of specific anecdotes.\n",
      "6. **Evidence policy**: Every concrete feedback item (positive or negative) must include at least one direct quote drawn from the evaluations excerpts; if multiple judges contributed, show them all.\n",
      "7. **Consistency**: If judges conflict, favor the view with denser, clearer evidence and higher indicated severity. Note resolved conflicts silently (do not show meta-discussion).\n",

      "Produce **two sections**—nothing else:\n",

      "   For each feedback item, use this exact structure (repeat for all items):\n",
      "\n",
      "   * **Title:** Short, action-oriented label (e.g., “Quantify Results with Baseline→Delta→Timeframe”).\n",
      "   * **Direct quotes:** Relevant quotes from the interview transcript (NOT the evaluations).\n",
      "   * **Evaluation:** Why this answer is good or bad\n",
      "   * **Job context:** Why this is important for this job/role.\n",
      "   * **Best practices:** Tips and tricks for providing better answers to questions like this.\n",
      "\n",
      "# ADDITIONAL GUIDELINES\n",
      "\n",
      "* Only synthesize to the evaluations provided, do not make up any information, do not create your own evaluation of the candidate's performance.\n",
      "* No JSON, no code blocks, no meta-commentary about your process.\n",
      "* If a requested element has no sufficient evidence, omit it rather than guessing.\n",

       "'# Performance Summary\\n\\nYou demonstrated solid foundational strengths by clearly communicating your past account management experience—especially your ability to lead through crises and your awareness of market trends impacting customer needs. Your examples of collaboration with internal teams and data-driven adjustments to inventory showed good alignment with the key account management responsibilities at Coca-Cola Northeast. However, your answers often lacked specific metrics or outcomes that quantify your impact, which is crucial to showcase your effectiveness in this role. Moreover, your early statement of motivation focused solely on financial gain and didn’t connect to the company’s mission or the relational aspects of the position, making your fit less compelling. Finally, some of your closing questions were too casual or off-topic, missing opportunities to demonstrate deeper engagement with the role and company.\\n\\nTo increase your chance of success in the real interview, focus on deepening your responses by adding measurable results, articulating how your motivations align with Coca-Cola’s values, and asking insightful, role-relevant questions that reflect your understanding of the company and its culture.\\n\\n# Aggregated Feedback (ordered by importance)\\n\\n* **Title:** Connect Motivation Beyond Financial Gain to Company and Role  \\n  **Direct quotes:** \"I\\'d really like to make money.\"  \\n  **Evaluation:** This candid but narrow motivation does not demonstrate alignment with Coca-Cola’s mission or the relational and strategic demands of the Account Manager role. Interviewers expect motivations rooted in passion for the industry, helping customers succeed, and personal development alongside financial reward.  \\n  **Job context:** The role requires building and maintaining strong client relationships and driving mutual growth, which demands a motivation framed beyond just monetary gain.  \\n  **Best practices:** When discussing motivation, combine financial goals with intrinsic interests—such as enthusiasm for the beverage industry, commitment to customer success, or desire to grow professionally within Coca-Cola. Use phrases like \"I am motivated by the challenge of growing client businesses while representing a brand I believe in.\"\\n\\n* **Title:** Provide Specific Metrics and Outcomes to Quantify Impact  \\n  **Direct quotes:**  \\n  - \"In the end what could have been a real crisis turned into a minor convenience and there was no significant impact on revenue.\"  \\n  - \"This was done recently so the project is still gathering results...\"  \\n  - \"Revenue/profit for each store and quantity of \\'excess\\' inventory.\"  \\n  **Evaluation:** Your examples illustrate relevant situations and actions, but the absence of concrete metrics or clear outcomes leaves your effectiveness undercommunicated. Interviewers need to see how your interventions led to measurable benefits, such as revenue retention, improved customer satisfaction, or inventory reductions.  \\n  **Job context:** Account Managers must demonstrate results-oriented thinking by linking activities to performance indicators and business growth.  \\n  **Best practices:** Structure your answers using the STAR framework—describe the Situation, Task, the specific Action you took, and the tangible Results with numbers or percentages whenever possible. For ongoing projects, state expected outcomes with supporting rationale or progress indicators.\\n\\n* **Title:** Expand Details on Relevant Experience and Skills  \\n  **Direct quotes:** \"I\\'ve worked as an account manager for Pepsi in the past.\"  \\n  **Evaluation:** Mentioning past account management experience at a competitor like Pepsi positions you well for this role, but you need to elaborate on your responsibilities, skills used, and successes to clearly demonstrate fit.  \\n  **Job context:** The position requires at least one year of relevant sales experience with proven ability to manage accounts effectively.  \\n  **Best practices:** Offer concrete examples of your achievements in previous roles, including sales targets met, client relationships strengthened, or strategic initiatives you led. Linking learned skills to how you would add value at Coca-Cola strengthens your candidacy.\\n\\n* **Title:** Demonstrate Proactive Crisis Leadership with Clear Action Steps  \\n  **Direct quotes:** \"I got everyone in a room together and we looked at the local roads...\"  \\n  **Evaluation:** Your example of orchestrating emergency meetings and coordinating teams shows initiative and leadership during crises—a vital Account Manager trait. However, to increase impact, clarify your specific role and highlight any quantifiable positive fallout from your actions.  \\n  **Job context:** Clients rely on Account Managers to handle unforeseen challenges effectively, safeguarding business continuity and relationships.  \\n  **Best practices:** When recounting crisis management, clearly define your leadership role, describe key decisions made, and link those to customer retention or revenue preservation outcomes.\\n\\n* **Title:** Illustrate Analytical Use of Market Trends to Drive Inventory and Sales Adjustments  \\n  **Direct quotes:**  \\n  - \"My region has been experiencing a bit of a health craze this year.\"  \\n  - \"We worked with our data analytics team to break down consumption habits by region and by specific stores.\"  \\n  **Evaluation:** Showing awareness of changing consumer preferences and collaborating with analytics teams demonstrates good situational awareness and teamwork. However, you should further explain how you translated those insights into concrete inventory or sales strategy changes and their impacts.  \\n  **Job context:** Adjusting product placements, promotional programs, and inventory based on market trends is core to the role’s success in growing sales and profitability.  \\n  **Best practices:** Discuss specific actions taken based on data insights—such as shifting product mix or promotional focus—and quantify the resulting increase in sales, reduction of waste, or improved customer satisfaction.\\n\\n* **Title:** Highlight Collaborative Communication that Drives Results  \\n  **Direct quotes:** \"Communication must be frequent and clear.\"  \\n  **Evaluation:** You emphasize the importance of collaboration and clear communication, which aligns well with internal teamwork demands. To strengthen this, share concrete examples where your communication led to successful project outcomes or resolution of client issues.  \\n  **Job context:** Effective communication across marketing, sales, and distribution teams ensures coherent account strategies and customer satisfaction.  \\n  **Best practices:** Include examples detailing when you scheduled meetings or coordinated information flow that accelerated problem-solving or enhanced performance, and note any resulting business metrics.\\n\\n* **Title:** Ask Insightful, Role-Relevant Questions Demonstrating Genuine Interest  \\n  **Direct quotes:**  \\n  - \"What does a company like Coca Cola offer that other companies can\\'t or don\\'t?\"  \\n  - \"What is your favorite beverage?\"  \\n  **Evaluation:** Your thoughtful question about Coca-Cola’s differentiators shows engagement and understanding, but the question about the interviewer’s favorite beverage was too casual and off-topic for the professional setting.  \\n  **Job context:** Your closing questions are an opportunity to reinforce fit, curiosity about the role, and alignment with company culture.  \\n  **Best practices:** Prepare focused questions on company strategy, team dynamics, expectations for success in the role, or growth opportunities. Avoid personal or light-hearted queries that may reduce your perceived professionalism.\\n\\n* **Title:** Frame Ongoing Projects with Expected Outcomes or Learnings  \\n  **Direct quotes:** \"This was done recently so the project is still gathering results, but it\\'s trending towards a positive outcome.\"  \\n  **Evaluation:** Mentioning ongoing initiatives shows awareness of current work but leaves interviewers uncertain about your ability to evaluate project success. Be ready to discuss anticipated benefits or interim insights.  \\n  **Job context:** The role requires analytic rigor and decision-making backed by data and results.  \\n  **Best practices:** When discussing projects in progress, outline key metrics you track and the benchmarks you expect to meet, demonstrating results-oriented thinking despite incomplete data.\\n\\n* **Title:** Enrich Industry Knowledge with Specifics About Tools and Market Dynamics  \\n  **Direct quotes:** \"It sounds like you have a solid approach to collaboration and adjustment.\"  \\n  **Evaluation:** Your basic acknowledgement of collaboration is positive, but deeper understanding of industry-specific tools (like CRM systems or sales force automation) was limited.  \\n  **Job context:** Proficiency with Coca-Cola’s sales tools and familiarity with beverage market trends is expected for efficient account management and strategic planning.  \\n  **Best practices:** Familiarize yourself with common industry software and current challenges faced by beverage companies, and be prepared to speak confidently about how you use technology and market data to enhance sales performance.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis comprehensive synthesis should empower you to refine your interview technique and present your experience, motivations, and skills in ways precisely tailored to what Coca-Cola Northeast values in their Account Managers.'"
