export const HOW_THIS_WORKS_POPUP_CONTENT = `## Getting Started

Start by entering the URL for the job listing you're applying to and attaching any documents about your background—think resume, cover letter, LinkedIn profile, or anything else that tells your professional story.

## Research & Preparation

We'll dive deep into researching the company, the role, and the broader industry. From this research, we build a comprehensive guide that covers what they're looking for in a candidate and how strong candidates can best present themselves.

## Practice Interview

Jump into a mock interview with an expert bot that's been trained on everything we learned. The conversation adapts based on your responses, so each interview feels authentic and unique to how you present yourself.

## Detailed Feedback

After your interview, you'll receive detailed insights on each of your responses. You'll understand what you did well, where you can improve, and learn how to present yourself more effectively and handle challenging questions.

## Keep Improving

Run additional mock interviews to continue sharpening your skills. With each round, you'll learn and adjust based on the feedback until you feel confident and ready for the real thing.`;

The files you attach should be about you: your background, experience, and qualifications. Think resumes, cover letters, LinkedIn profile exports, portfolio summaries, or anything else that tells your professional story. These materials help us personalize both the interview experience and the feedback you'll receive, tailoring everything to your specific experiences.
